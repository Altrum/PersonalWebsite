- Image in Post.jsx needs to be center not at front.
- Books page
- Projects page
- Uploading image within ghost and then getting image after (can be done via static foler i think)
- Actual footer
- Incorporate Read-Time
- image container on the actual posts page so that we can use all kinds of image sizes and it wont look bad
- Resize nav bar to use hamburger when it gets to mobile size
- Needs to be Mobile friendly...
