=== DONE ===
x React routing
x Actual posts page (link it to the actual page)
x Each text object should lead to the page within the blog posts page
x Recent Posts alignment
x About page setup
x Redo design for top part of layout. Also means there needs to be a way to get to the blog posts easier
x localhost 8000 (gatsby develop) doesn't fetch the latest stuff from ghost after deployment?
x About page re-rendering and getting rid of the content during production?? Not sure why (due to nested <p> tags. Cant have that)
x Actual footer
x Footer is broken; the colors are not actually rendering and it's not actually sticking to bottom either
x Needs to be Mobile friendly...
  x Resize nav bar to use hamburger when it gets to mobile size
x Need to change query for ghost to have articles only render posts that have tag: 'blog'
x Books page
x SEO stuff
x Image in Post.jsx needs to be center not at front.
x Deployment for everytime we update ghost
  x Everytime we have ghost change run the `npm run deploy` command which will:
    x npm build && deploy
    x upload to s3 (run command)
    x invalidate cloudfront cache
x Logo not showing up
x When in mobile theres a horizontal scroll. Let's get rid of that
x any kind of navigation flashes the "hidden" components for mobile friendly stuff... not sure why; 
  maybe it's the rendering order? Maybe in the beginning media query always hits?
    -> This is kinda unavoidable since we're generating a static website. Currently have it so that default is desktop...
       Not the best setup but since we don't have the DOM/window at buildtime, this is best we can do. 
x Maybe put down ec2 until it's needed?
  x Could use API gateway to trigger lambda to spin up the ec2?
x Image upload to s3 and correctly link it in the actual site
x Backup data from ec2 stuff (just use the s3 bucket itself as backup tbh)

=== QUESTIONABLE ===
? Cache bust on client: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49456841/browser-cache-busting-on-s3-cloudfront

=== HIGH PRIORITY ===
- Make sure Ghost post query with pagination works correctly
- image sizing for each post (inside the actual posts page)
  - image container on the actual posts page so that we can use all kinds of image sizes and it wont look bad
- Faster fonts loading thing? (self hosted fonts)

=== LOW PRIORITY ===
- Incorporate Read-Time
- Search functionality?
- footer is actually not sticking as I want it to but it'll be fine if there's more posts overall
- Projects page (currently just removed it since nothings there anyways)
- Get rid of npm packages that we dont need
